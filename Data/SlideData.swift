They require advanced techniques, strong paddling, and a deep understanding of wave dynamics. Surfing these waves can be exhilarating but also demands respect for the ocean's power", arModelName: "surfboard3"),

Only the most experienced surfers tackle these giants, which require specialized equipment and often a team for safety. The thrill and danger of these waves are unparalleled, making them a badge of honor in the surfing community.", arModelName: "surfboard3"),

This size range is for elite big wave surfers who specialize in conquering ocean giants. It requires immense physical preparation, mental strength, and often, tow-in assistance due to the sheer size and speed of the waves. The vibrations of these waves crashing often make it miles into shore", arModelName: "surfboard3"),

These conditions offer more consistent and powerful waves, attracting intermediate and advanced surfers. The predictability of wave patterns allows for a high-quality surfing experience, but the presence of rocks increases the risk of injury. \n\nThe most famous surf break, the Banzai Pipeline located in Hawaii, has a primarally Lava Rock Reef!", arModelName: "surfboard3"),
